Almost immedietly after selecting the input data file, the program will end. The program will have outputted a file in the same folder as the executable a file called "OUTPUT_CalendarEvents.csv". This CSV file contains the events to import into your Google Calendar. The instructions to import a CSV file into Google Calendar can be found here.

I recommend creating a new calendar to import the birthdays. This way, if there is any issue with the program, you can simply delete the bad calendar, rather than having to sift through your main calendar. Instructions to create a new calendar can be found here.
